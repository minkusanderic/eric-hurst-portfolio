Generate a PDF from HTML

When constructing this site, I needed a way to export my Resume, that was formated in HTML, into a PDF that I could send to potential employers. I found many of the tools out there would use A4 as the default viewport size when formating the HTML to convert to PDF. While this worked, it did not give quite the feel that I was looking for. The viewport was too small, making the PDF a few pages long, and the text unneccesarily long. Enter wkhtmltopdf. This Linux tool takes in an HTML source and outputs a PDF. wkhtmltopdf uses the webkit engine under the hood, so it provides the flexability and compatablitiy that I needed. I was able to customize what the viewport that it used to render the HTML, giving me the look I needed. Here is how I used the command line:

wkhtmltopdf --viewport-size 1000x1000 http://dev.regionsyx.com:8000/resume/ tmp.pdf

Back fromt he 70's, I see more and more astronomical signs being asked of people. Here we write a simple python function to determine your sign.

There is a little know easter egg in the python implementation known as the Zen of python

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
</pre>

<p>
This zen represents the "python" way. Python is a language known to have one "right" way to style and structure code. This leads to a stronger sense of community and more consistant (readable) code in general.
